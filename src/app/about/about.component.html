<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I currently work as a Systems Administrator. I am looking to further my
  knowledge in technology so that I can build my skills.
</p>
<p>
  I am looking to transition into more development-focused work, and have been
  studying various programming languages for that.
</p>
<p>Outside of my work, I also enjoy gaming and occasionally streaming.</p>
<p>I dabble a bit in art as well.</p>
